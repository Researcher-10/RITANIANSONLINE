        <h2>Brief History of Sta. Rita National High School</h2>
        
        <p>Sta Rita National High School was founded on July 1967 through the effort of Cabiao officials headed by then Mayor Gregorio T. Crespo. Formerly known as Sta Rita Barangay High School, it was established for the cause of bringing education closer not only to the youth of Barangay Sta. Rita but also to the nearby community of Concepcion, San Vicente, and Sta. Isabel.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In its early years of establishment, the school was run in a single compound with Sta Rita Elementary School, occupying 8 of its classrooms, and under the supervision of one principal named Mr. Mauro Hernandez. It started with five teachers in service and few enrollees, but remarkably both increase in numbers for not so long a period of time. During that time, compensation of teachers relied on the payment of studentsâ€™ fees.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 1993, the school owned a parcel of land registered under its name through the collaborative effort of the barangay officials headed by then Brgy. Captain Fortunato Pineda with the cooperation of Federated Parents Association. In the same year, SEDP building was also constructed; this was followed by additional buildings/facilities donated by the politicians Julita Villareal and Aurelio Umali, and two more others by Security Bank.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At present, the school has 27 teaching staff, three utilities, and three ADAS headed by Dr. Lea Joy M. Cuenco.</p>
